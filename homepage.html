	<h3>The CPU</h3>
	<p>The central processing unit is known as the brain of a laptop, and is responsible for executing all of the instructions from software programs to processing data in the laptop. Processing speed refers to the number of cycles that a CPU can perform per second, typically shown in GHz. For example, a CPU with a clock rate of 2.6GHz can perform 2.6 billion clock cycles a second. There are also two main categories of CPU, 32-bit and 64-bit, referring to the amount of data the processors can handle at once.</p>
	<h3>The GPU</h3>
	<p>The graphical processing unit is a specialized processor designed to handle graphics and visual data. There are two types of GPUs found in laptops, an integrated GPU, which is where the GPU component is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. The second type is a dedicated GPU which is more powerful than an integrated GPU which is designed for more high-end tasks.</p>
	<h3>RAM</h3>
	<p>The random access memory is the temporary memory in the laptop, the contents of which disappear when the power supply is turned off. Most laptops use SO-DIMM (small outline dual in-line memory modules), which are about half the size of desktop DIMMS. In most laptops, the RAM is located on the motherboard. Entry level laptops often have 8GB of RAM, being useful for basic tasks like web browsing, and light gaming. Mid-range laptops usually have up to 16GB of RAM, more suitable for multitasking, gaming, and some professional software. Higher-end laptops can come with 32GB, more suitable for video editing and high-end gaming.</p>
	<h3>ROM</h3>
	<p>Read-only memory is a type of memory that is not deleted when the power supply is switched off, and is where the information that helps manage the communication between the hardware and the operating system during the boot process.</p>
	<h3>HDD</h3>
	<p>Older laptops use Hard Disk Drives to store data, composed of a series of platters that rotate at high speeds. Data is stored on tracks on these platters. HDDS contain moving parts, which can be damaged when dropped.</p>
	<h3>SDD</h3>
	<p>The Solid State Drive is more compact to a HDD, and offers a higher data transfer rate, lower power consumption, and larger storage capacity. SDDS use flash memory to store data, allowing for quicker boot times, faster file access, and improved system responsiveness.</p>
	<h3>Motherboard</h3>
	<p>The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects the components of the laptop. It connects the CPU, RAM, GPU, storage devices, and other components. It provides ways for these components to communicate and function with each other</p>
	<h3>Battery</h3>
	<p>Most laptops use rechargeable lithium-ion batteries or lithium polymer batteries, which offer high energy density, a long life cycle, and low self-discharge rates. The battery provides power to your laptop when not plugged into an external power supply. </p>

	    <h2>Different uses for laptops</h2>
	</header>
    <article>
		<p>Depending on what you will be using your laptop for, different components become more important than others </p>
		<h3>Productivity</h3>
		<p>Using a laptop for work or for studying needs a fast CPU and a decent amount of RAM, allowing the user to run multiple applications at the same time without the laptop slowing down. Large amounts of storage (512GB – 1TB) allows the user to store any required applications and files. Using Windows as an operating system can be useful as it includes programs like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. For more creative work, e.g. art, design work, the MacBook operating system can be more desirable with amazing displays and fast processors designed for creative processes, however a MacBook comes at a considerably larger cost. A large battery is also desirable as using more demanding applications can drain the battery quicker.</p>
		<h3>General browsing</h3>
		<p>Using a laptop for browsing and general everyday use does not require a high-end processor, and a smaller amount of RAM (8GB-16GB) will work fine. A decent sized battery will do as most applications used will not drain the battery as quick as using a laptop for other purposes. A Chromebook is one of the best choices, as most can be bought for a low price with a decent performance relative to that price. </p>
		<h3>Gaming</h3>
		<p>If using a laptop for light gaming, similar components to the ones in a laptop for productivity is desirable, as light gaming does not require high-end and expensive components. However, if you are looking to play the latest modern high-end games, at least 16GB of RAM will be needed, alongside a high-end CPU and even a dedicated laptop graphics card, opposed to the integrated graphics card found in most laptops, which is a part of the CPU. A high-end monitor that includes a high 120Hz refresh rate and a high-resolution screen (1440p, 4K) is desirable to get the best experience. A laptop for light gaming can be expected to be priced in the £500-£700 range, with a high-end gaming laptop costing between £700 and £3000+, with the most expensive laptops including the latest processors, 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and a 4090 16GB GPU.</p>
